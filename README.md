# DSA Practice Repository

## About
I'm Monish, a second-year AIML student at BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore. This repository tracks my journey learning Data Structures and Algorithms in preparation for placements in 2028.

## Current Progress

**Problems Solved: 20**
- HackerRank: 10
- LeetCode: 10

**Topics Covered:**
- C++ fundamentals (variables, loops, conditionals)
- Arrays and array manipulation
- Strings and string manipulation
- Vectors (dynamic arrays)
- Pointers (introduction)
- Time complexity basics (Big O notation)
- Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort)
- Two pointer technique

**Currently Working On:**
- Array and string problems
- Understanding algorithm efficiency

## Goals

**Short-term (6 months):**
- Solve 200+ problems across HackerRank and LeetCode
- Cover all basic DSA topics
- Start building small projects

**Long-term (2 years):**
- Solve 500+ problems by December 2027
- Build 4-5 solid ML projects
- Secure a good internship in third year
- Be placement-ready by final year

## Timeline

- Day 1-3: C++ fundamentals, basic programs
- Day 4: Strings, vectors, started LeetCode
- Day 5: Time complexity, sorting, array problems
